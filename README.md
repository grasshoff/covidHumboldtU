# Modeling COVID dissemination for a model population of Humboldt University at Berlin

(Prof. Dr. Gerd Gra√ühoff, Faculty of Philosophy) 

For the Humboldt University subpopulation I have set the following parameters: A university size of 200 000 persons involved (students, employees, families). To make the temporal scales easy to read, we assume 1 February 2020 as day 0 for the first infection. The temporal progression of the numbers can be estimated by addition (e.g. April 1 = day 60, June 1 = day 120). From day 50.
